Quasi-deviance Change-point Estimation by Ronald Braun

Change-points are a useful statistical model. The C++ research code 
in this archive was developed to explore the properties of the 
quasi-deviance change-point estimation methodology.  The quasi-likelihood 
is a semi-parametric extension of the likelihood. 

The methodology is described in:

fitting via quasilikelihood, with application to DNA sequence segmentation.
